# Genepool2

WIP: flow thoughts

* User downloads standalone executable and runs it -> evolution master
* it asks for run directory
* it asks for gene manifest. URL or file accepted -> brood
* it resolves web access -> evolution master
* it retrieves repos from manifest and repos' manifests' repos until all repos are retrieved -> repos: genepool, retriver -> evolution master
* it installs python and runs each gene -> evolution master
